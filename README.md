Our code sorts through all the options with a combination of if, elif & while loops. Each different selection calls a corresponding function that sorts through our database to print out the information. Our Cli code is defined as a class that on the __init__ uses a session.query() to create the attribute self.course, self.students, self.grades to access the inforamtion needed for the functionality.
